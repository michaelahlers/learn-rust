## Rationale

I've been building software (professionally) on the [Java platform][java] since 1999 (as of this writing, a solid two decades), beginning with the natural language then switching to [Scala][scala-lang] in 2012 (having introduced it to my team at Verizon Business, about 12 years ago).

Prior to Scala, I'd see it all on the Java platform: Applets; Tomcat, [JBoss][jboss-eap], [Glassfish][glassfish]; [Servlets][java-servlets], [JavaServer Pages][java-server-pages], [JavaServer Faces][java-server-faces], [Seam][jboss-seam]; WebSphere; Apache projects; [Ant][ant-build], [Maven][maven-build]; innumerable design patterns to work around the Java language's absurdly bad designâ€¦ ðŸ¤¯

Entering Scala was a huge breath of fresh air. It took years for me to truly understand and adopt and apply functional programming and category theory to software engineering, butâ€”once I didâ€”the gains in my productivity and quality of life as a developer were _enormous_.

Whole classes of bugs were rendered impossible. Your compiler did so much more of grunt work for you. Abandoning imperative, object-oriented methodologies in favor of functions and types imparted confidence that if your program compiled it was also correct.

It was gaining traction for over a decade until it wasn't. There's a raging debate as to why Scala adoption slowed and started to reverse. I won't get into that here except to offer that I don't blame the language or the tooling. Instead, it may be that many struggle to give up procedures and "go to" semantics despite most purporting to accept [Edsger Dijkstra's seminal work on the subject][considered-harmful].

Most Scala code I've seen in practice is rife with object-oriented patterns, exception throwing and handling, and hardly even an attempt at getting the compiler working for the developer. Used this way, as yet another imperative language, teams incur a high cost without netting any returns on their investment. I find it frustrating because I believe (and will, perhaps, for a while depending on how I find [Rust][rust-lang]) that Scala is _the_ best language available to industry today. But I'm also starting to see the writing on the wall.

What's a pragmatist, who wants to maintain viable marketability in this industry, to do?

For starters, I don't want to give up on all the joys Scala's given. I want functions. I want monads. I want algebraic data types. I want type classes.

Trouble is, the overwhelming majority of programming languages in vogue todayâ€”Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, Javaâ€”do little more than rehash outmoded ideas that we've known for decades now lead to brittle, unstable programs. Even _if_ they've since adopted a few of Scala's innovations, a slightly different naming convention and mixed up syntax isn't moving the needle.

Only one language stands out from the field, and it's one I've neglected to pay much attention to until recently.

So, let's learn [Rust][rust-lang].

## Best Practices

Out the gate, I'm aiming for rigor with this exercise. Formatting, linting, testing and so forth. Also, modules to organize my exercises. As always, I want to form habits based on the best possible engineering practices.
